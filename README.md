Hypothetica

AI-Powered Research Originality Assessment with Multi-Agent RAG

Overview

Hypothetica is an AI-powered system that evaluates the originality of research ideas by comparing them against existing academic literature.
Instead of simple text similarity or plagiarism detection, Hypothetica performs conceptual, sentence-level novelty analysis using a multi-agent architecture, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and evidence-grounded reasoning.

The system is designed to help researchers, students, and early-stage innovators answer a critical question before committing months of work:

“Is my research idea actually novel?”



 What Makes Hypothetica Different?

Most existing tools:
	•	Detect text overlap, not idea overlap
	•	Provide opaque similarity scores
	•	Do not explain why something is considered unoriginal

Hypothetica instead:
	•	Evaluates conceptual originality, not plagiarism
	•	Produces sentence-level explanations
	•	Links every originality claim to retrieved academic evidence
	•	Uses multi-agent reasoning instead of a single LLM prompt



Core Features

Conceptual Originality Assessment
	•	Compares a user’s research idea against recent academic papers from arXiv
	•	Identifies overlaps in:
	•	Technical problem definition
	•	Methodology
	•	Application domain
	•	Innovation claims

Multi-Agent Architecture

Specialized LLM agents handle different stages:
	•	Keyword Agent – generates structured search queries
	•	Relevance Ranking Agent – selects the most relevant papers
	•	Layer-1 Analysis Agent – evaluates each paper independently
	•	Layer-2 Aggregation Agent – synthesizes global originality insights

Each agent operates with task-specific parameters for reliability and determinism.

Structured, Explainable Scoring
	•	Outputs a 0–100 originality score
	•	Uses Likert-scale categorical judgments instead of unreliable continuous scoring
	•	Assigns sentence-level originality labels:
	•	🟢 High originality
	•	🟡 Medium originality
	•	🔴 Low originality

Each flagged sentence is linked to specific evidence from retrieved papers.

 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
	•	Papers are embedded using E5 embeddings
	•	Stored and retrieved via ChromaDB
	•	Ensures all LLM reasoning is grounded in real academic content

 Evaluation Highlights
	•	Tested on 10 diverse research ideas
	•	Correctly assigns very low scores to:
	•	Image classification
	•	Sentiment analysis
	•	YOLO reproductions
	•	Rewards true novelty and novel domain combinations
	•	Average cost per evaluation: ~$0.013
	•	Stable, deterministic scoring across repeated runs



Known Limitations
	•	Current corpus is limited to academic literature (arXiv)
	•	Does not detect commercial product cloning
	•	e.g., a “Facebook-like social network” may score high
